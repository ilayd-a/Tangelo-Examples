    "Tangelo provides convenient ways to help you run experiments on quantum hardware.

Here's what Tangelo provides to support you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connection objects that act as a convenience wrapper for job management, which underneath uses whatever API the hardware provider exposed (qiskit-runtime, braket, Rest API...). It's simple, covers most usage, and gets you submitting jobs in no time. No need to learn about all the different APIs !\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation functions that can convert your quantum circuits and operators in the desired format (qiskit, braket, OpenQASM, IonQ JSON...). You can then use the API of your choice directly, for full control. Useful if you need very fine control and want to run an edge case not yet covered by the connection objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of what you pick: you are responsible for configuring the environment allowing you to submit jobs, and entering your own credentials. You are billed directly by the target quantum cloud service(s), Tangelo is simply here as a helpful, transparent middleman.\n",

    "This approach is an alternative to using [QEMIST Cloud](https://goodchemistry.com/qemist-cloud/), which we intend to make a single and convenient entry point to reach many different platforms. What's pretty cool with this other option is that users do not have to set up the environment required by the quantum cloud(s) of their choice or even an account with those services. A QEMIST Cloud account provides a single entry point enabling you to reach all of them, and pay with your QEMIST Cloud credits.\n",

Check out their [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/concepts-circuits) for the most reliable information.\n",

    "Our generated Q# code is compatible with both the local QDK simulator (good for testing before submitting to an actual QPU) or by Azure Quantum. Submission through Azure Quantum will require the user to have an account on Azure, install the local CLI and Python dependencies. For an example of how one can use this package to first generate circuits, and then submit jobs through Azure quantum, please look into the `example/qsharp` folder of this package.\n",
